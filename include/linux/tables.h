/**
 * DOC: Introduction
 *
 * A linker table is a data structure that is stitched together from items
 * in multiple object files. Linux has historically implicitly used linker
 * tables for ages, however they were all built in an adhoc manner which
 * requires linker script modifications, per architecture. This linker table
 * solution provides a general linker table facility so that a new linker table
 * can be implemented by changing C code only.
 *
 * Linker tables help you simplify init sequences by using ELF sections, linker
 * build time selective sorting (disabled options get ignored), and can
 * optionally also be used to help you avoid code bit-rot due to #ifdery
 * collateral.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Linker table provenance and userspace testing
 *
 * The Linux implementation of linker tables is derivative of iPXE linker
 * table's solution (iPXE commit 67a10ef000cb7 [0]).  To see how this code
 * evolved or to extend and test and use this code in userspace refer to the
 * userspace linker-table tree [1].  This repository can be used for ease of
 * testing of extensions and sampling of changes prior to inclusion into Linux,
 * it is intended to be kept up to date to match Linux's solution. Contrary to
 * iPXE's solution, which strives to force compilation of everything using
 * linker tables, Linux's solution allows for developers to be selective over
 * where one wishes to force compilation, this then is just an optional feature
 * for the Linux linker table solution.

/**
 * DOC: The code bit-rot problem
 *
 * Overuse of C #ifdefs can be problematic for certain types of code.  Linux
 * provides a rich array of features, but all these features take up valuable
 * space in a kernel image. The traditional solution to this problem has been
 * for each feature to have its own Kconfig entry and for the respective code
 * to be wrapped around #ifdefs, allowing the feature to be compiled in only
 * if desired.
 *
 * The problem with this is that over time it becomes very difficult and time
 * consuming to compile, let alone test, all possible versions of Linux. Code
 * that is not typically used tends to suffer from bit-rot over time. It can
 * become difficult to predict which combinations of compile-time options will
 * result in code that can compile and link correctly.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Avoiding the code bit-rot problem when desirable
 *
 * To solve the code bit-rot problem linker tables can be used on Linux, it
 * enables you to always force compiling of select features that one wishes to
 * avoid bit-rot while still enabling you to disable linking feature code into
 * the final kernel image if the features have been disabled via Kconfig.
 * Linux's linker tables allows for developers to be selective over where one
 * wishes to take advantage of the optional feature of forcing compilation and
 * only linking in enabled features.
 *
 * To use linker tables and to optionally take advantage of avoiding code
 * bit-rot, feature code should be implemented in separate C files, and should
 * be designed to always be compiled -- they should not be guarded with a C
 * code #ifdef CONFIG_FOO statements, consideration must also be taken for
 * sub-features which depend on the main CONFIG_FOO option, as they will be
 * disabled if they depend on CONFIG_FOO and therefore not compiled. To force
 * compilation and only link when features are needed a new optional target
 * table-y can be used on Makefiles, documented below.
 *
 * Currently only built-in features are supported, modular support is not
 * yet supported, however you can make use of sub-features for modules
 * if they are independent and can simply be linked into modules.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Using target table-y and table-n
 *
 * Let's assume we want to always force compilation of feature FOO in the
 * kernel but avoid linking it. When you enable the FOO feature via Kconfig
 * you'd end up with:
 *
 *	#define CONFIG_FOO 1
 *
 * You typically would then just use this on your Makefile to selectively
 * compile and link the feature:
 *
 *	obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo.o
 *
 * You could instead optionally use the new linker table object:
 *
 *	table-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo.o
 *
 * Alternatively, this would be the equivalent of listing:
 *
 *	extra += foo.o
 *	obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo.o
 *
 * Both are mechanisms which can be used to take advantage of forcing
 * compilation with linker tables, however making use of table-$(CONFIG_FOO)
 * is encouraged as it helps with annotating linker tables clearly where
 * compilation is forced.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Opting out of forcing compilation
 *
 * If you want to opt-out of forcing compilation you would use the typical
 * obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo.o and foo.o will only be compiled and linked
 * in when enabled. Using both table-$(CONFIG_FOO) and obj-($CONFIG_FOO)
 * will result with the feature on your binary only if you've enabled
 * CONFIG_FOO, however using table-$(CONFIG_FOO) will always force compilation,
 * this is why avoiding code bit-rot is an optional fature for Linux linker
 * tables.
 */

/**
 * DOC: How linker tables simplify inits
 *
 * Traditionally, we would implement features in C code as follows:
 *
 *	foo_init();
 *
 * You'd then have a foo.h which would have:
 *
 *	#ifdef CONFIG_FOO
 *	#else
 *	static inline void foo(void) { }
 *	#endif
 *
 * With linker tables this is no longer necessary as your init routines would
 * be implicit, you'd instead call:
 *
 *	call_init_fns();
 *
 * call_init_fns() would call all functions present in your init table and if
 * and only if foo.o gets linked in, then its initialisation function will be
 * called, whether you use obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) or table-$(CONFIG_FOO).
 *
 * The linker script takes care of assembling the tables for us. All of our
 * table sections have names of the format SECTION_NAME*.tbl.NAME.N. Here
 * SECTION_NAME is one of the standard sections in include/linux/sections.h,
 * and NAME designates the specific use case for the linker table, the table.
 * N is a digit decimal number used to impose an "order level" upon the tables
 * if required. NN= (empty string) is reserved for the symbol indicating "table
 * start", and N=~ is reserved for the symbol indicating "table end". In order
 * for the call_init_fns() to work behind the scenes the custom linker script
 * would need to define the beginning of the table, the end of the table, and
 * in between it should use SORT() to give order-level effect. Now, typically
 * such type of requirements would require custom linker script modifications
 * but Linux's linker tables builds on top of already existing standard Linux
 * ELF sections, each with different purposes. This lets you build and add
 * new tables without needing custom linker script modifications. This is
 * also done to support all architectures. All that is needed then is to
 * ensure a respective common linker table entry is added to the shared
 * include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h. There should be a respective:
 *
 *	*(SORT(SECTION_TBL_ALL(SECTION_NAME)))
 *
 * entry for each type of supported section there. If your SECTION_NAME
 * is not yet supported, consider adding support for it.
 *
 * The order-level is really only a helper, if only one order level is
 * used, the next contributing factor to order is the order of the code
 * in the C file, and the order of the objects in the Makefile. Using
 * an order level then should not really be needed in most cases, its
 * use however enables to compartamentalize code into tables where ordering
 * through C file or through the Makefile would otherwise be very difficult
 * or if one wanted to enable very specific initialization semantics.
 *
 * As an example, suppose that we want to create a "frobnicator"
 * feature framework, and allow for several independent modules to
 * provide frobnicating services. Then we would create a frob.h
 * header file containing e.g.
 *
 *	struct frobnicator {
 *		const char *name;
 *		void (*frob) (void);
 *	};
 *
 *	DECLARE_LINKTABLE_INIT(struct frobnicator, frobnicator_fns);
 *
 * Any module providing frobnicating services would look something
 * like
 *
 *	#include "frob.h"
 *	static void my_frob(void) {
 *		... Do my frobnicating
 *	}
 *	LINKTABLE(frobnicator_fns, all) my_frobnicator = {
 *		.name = "my_frob",
 *		.frob = my_frob,
 *	};
 *
 * The central frobnicator code (frob.c) would use the frobnicating
 * modules as follows
 *
 *	#include "frob.h"
 *
 *	void frob_all(void) {
 *		struct frob *frob;
 *
 *		LINKTABLE_FOR_EACH(frob, frobnicator_fns) {
 *			pr_info("Calling frobnicator \"%s\"\n", frob->name);
 *			frob->frob();
 *		}
 *	}
